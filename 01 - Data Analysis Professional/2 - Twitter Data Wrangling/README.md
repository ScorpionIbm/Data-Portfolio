We all love dogs, who doesn’t? There’s this twitter account named WeRateDogs (@dog\_rates) that recognized this fact and rates pictures of dogs with a sense of humor. The ratings are mostly scored out of 10 but then most of the dogs are rated over 10, why you ask? because they are good dogs.

Today, we are going to analyze the tweet contents to get insights about the activity of the account itself and what are the dogs that get top ratings.

  The data collected is about tweets going back to the start of the account till the first of August 2017. As wee see from the graph below, the account used to post more tweets at the start of the account creation to get the attention it deserves and reach the fame it has now and then after about 6 months (April 2016) have passed, the number of tweets made per month started to stabilize at around 45-50 tweets per month.

  But on the other hand, this didn’t mean that the account wasn’t relevant anymore but rather the following graph shows how the account tweets keep getting an ever-growing number of retweets and favorites.

  From the data we also get to see the time of day that the account usually posts tweets. The following graph shows that the account activity peaks at midnight, while there are nearly no tweets in the midday (obviously a time where people are at work/college and it will not be the best time to post tweets)

Turning to the dog data at hand, we look at the dog types rated by the account and investigate which ones get the highest ratings and from the next graph we can see that the top-rated dog breed is called “Clumber” and it got a whooping average rating of 27, which seemed odd, and with further investigations we found that the data only had one dog of that breed (we should have excluded it as being non-representative but then found it was really so cute – it’s the one on the report cover).

  The next top-rated breeds are “West highland white terrier”, “Borzoi” and “Soft-coated wheaten terrier”.

  On the other hand, if we look at the most rated dog breeds, In the following chart we see the Golden retriever being the most rated breed with around 120 rated dogs and then comes the Pembroke in second place with about 80 rated dogs.
