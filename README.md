# Data-Portfolio
This repo contains my Data Portfolio projects created throughout my learning journey.  
It's a little bit rough and is always a work in progress so bear with me through my journey...  
  
1. [Data Analysis Professional](./01%20-%20Data%20Analysis%20Professional):
  My journey started with this course on Udacity provided by the great program of EgyptFWD supported by Egypt's MICT.
  Two projects were created during this course:
    * BikeShare: This project represents a mini program written in **Python** to provide data analysis for data on a bikesharing service in the United States.
    * [Twitter wrangling project](./01%20-%20Data%20Analysis%20Professional/2%20-%20Twitter%20Data%20Wrangling): This projects shows the skills to use the **Twitter API** through **Python** to retrieve tweet data from a username by ID and use it in the analysis of dog ratings provided by the account. 
2. Advanced Data Analysis:
    * Investigate a dataset (Gun Data):
    * A/B testing:
    * Communicate Data findings (Loan Data):
3. Machine Learning:
    * Train **ML** models and compare:
4. Data Engineering (In progress):
    * SQL database ETL: use **Python** in tandem with an **PostgreSQL** driver to perform the ETL process using **SQL** 
    * Apache Cassandra ETL: use the **Apache Cassandra** driver for **Python** to perform the ETL process using **CQL**
